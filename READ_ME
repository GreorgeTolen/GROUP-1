Explanation

1. Block Class
This class represents an individual block in the blockchain.

Attributes:

index: Position of the block in the chain.
timestamp: The date and time when the block was created.
data: The information stored in the block (e.g., transaction details).
previous_hash: The hash of the previous block in the chain.
hash: The block's own hash, calculated using its attributes.
Methods:

calculate_hash(): Combines the block’s attributes into a single string and computes a hash using SHA-256. This ensures the block’s integrity.

2. Blockchain Class
This class represents the chain of blocks.

Attributes:

chain: A list of blocks in the blockchain.
Methods:

create_genesis_block(): Creates the first block in the blockchain, called the genesis block. It has a fixed previous hash of "0".
get_latest_block(): Retrieves the most recent block in the chain.
add_block(data): Creates a new block using the data provided, links it to the previous block, and appends it to the chain.
3. BlockchainExplorer Class
This class provides a GUI for viewing the blockchain using the Tkinter library.

GUI Components:

TreeView: Displays the blockchain in a tabular format.
Columns:
Address: The block’s hash.
Timestamp: When the block was created.
Data: The information stored in the block.
Validation: Shows whether the block’s hash is valid by recalculating it.
Methods:

show_gui(): Creates and displays the GUI window with the blockchain data.

4. Example Usage
The main function demonstrates how to use the Blockchain and BlockchainExplorer classes.
A Blockchain object is created.
Three blocks are added with sample data.
A BlockchainExplorer object is created to display the blockchain in a GUI.
